This repository is a collection of Git exercises. The concept is stolen without shame from Schauderhaft.de. Unfortunately, they have not maintained the system - and we need more good Git exercises.

The exercises are designed for use when we are teaching Git courses. You should be able to use them as self-contained exercises that will allow you to keep your Git skills sharp.

Exercises starting with basic are entry-level - other exercises vary greatly in difficulty.

To get an overview of the exercises in here look in Overview.md.

Feel free to use these exercises, that's why they're public!
